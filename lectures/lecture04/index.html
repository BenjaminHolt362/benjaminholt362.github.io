            Corvidae: Birds in the crow family have been observed using tools, counting, and forming friendships and grudges.

            Shrikes: Also known as butcherbirds, shrikes mark their territory by impaling prey on thorns and sharp branches.

			Birds of paradise: With an abundance of food and lack of predators in their native habitat, birds of paradise have some of the most elaborate plumage and mating rituals of any animal.
